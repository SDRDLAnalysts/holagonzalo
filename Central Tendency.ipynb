      "## The Mean, Median, and Mode of a Skewed Distribution\n",
      "\n",
      "When scores in a distribution are normally distributed, the mean, median, and mode are all at the same point: the center of the distribution. In the messy world of social science, however, the scores from a sample on a given variable are often not normally distributed. When the scores in a distribution tend to bunch up at one end of the distribution\n",
      "and there are a few scores at the other end, the distribution is said to be skewed.\n",
      "\n",
      "When working with a skewed distribution, the mean, median, and mode are usually all at different points. It is important to note that the procedures used to calculate a mean, median, and mode are the same whether you are dealing with a skewed or a normal distribution. All that changes are where these three measures of central tendency are in relation to each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "To illustrate, I created a fictional distribution of scores based on a sample size of 30. Suppose that I were to ask a sample of 30 randomly selected fifth graders whether they think it is important to do well in school. Suppose further that I ask them to rate how important they think it is to do well in school using a 5-point scale, with 1 = \u201cnot at all important\u201d and 5 = \u201cvery important.\u201d Because most fifth graders tend to believe it is very important to do well in school, most of the scores in this distribution are at the high end of the scale, with a few scores at the low end. I have arranged my fictitious scores in order from smallest to largest and get the following distribution:"
